There are three modes of operation available in the application:

- Augmented reality game where you need to feed animals:
    - several types of animals are available (monkeys, penguins, frogs)
    - several types of treats are available (banana, fish, snail)
    - just aim at the animal and throw treats at it 
    - if the animal likes the treat, then you will see a visual effect with the disappearance of the full animal
    - if the treat does not suit the animal then you will hear just the sound of a blow
    - the number of correct hits is being counted
    - the game time is fixed
    - the background melody can be turned off and on
    - the position of the generated animals in space is arbitrary
- An augmented reality game where you need to hit balls on rotating cubes like colors:
    - six colors of cubes are available
    - there are six colors of balls available for throwing
    - just aim at the cube and select a ball of the same color before throwing
    - if the animal likes the treat, then you will see a visual effect with the disappearance of the well-fed animal
    - if the treat does not suit the animal, then you will hear just the sound of a blow
    - the number of correct hits is being counted
    - the game time is fixed
    - the background melody can be turned off and on
    - the position of the generated animals in space is arbitrary
- Augmented Reality ruler:
    - you can measure the distance to an object in space (the distance between the device and the object will be displayed)
    - you can measure the distance between two points in space
    - you can use the 3D result switch
    - if 3D mode is enabled, the measurement result will be displayed in the space next to the measurement point
    - if 3D mode is disabled, the result will be displayed on the device screen
